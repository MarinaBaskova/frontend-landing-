# User Interface Project: FIFA 19 Statistics App

Pitch: Build a dashboard tool that allows users to browse FIFA 19 players and view their important statistics in a way that is both appealing and informative.

In this project, I designed and created a user interface from scratch for FIFA19 statistics. Build a single page website using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Features
* [ ] Created Landing/Marketing page and About page. Both pages are responsive on mobile, tablet and desktop views.

* [ ] Used LESS preprocessor for code reusability and cleaner code with variables, mixins, and functions.

* [ ] With vanilla JavaScript created a reusable component and added event listeners to some DOM elements.

* [ ] Applied GSAP for animations on both pages.
